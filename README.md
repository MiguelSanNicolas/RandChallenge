# RandChallenge
Code challenge

Justification:
My justification for the code design was to make it simple and easy to read code. 
Having the input stream closed is very important that is why I choose to use a try catch block with resources in order to close the input stream. 
One possible trade off is sending unparsable numeric input information, anyway if the input information is not valid there is nothing important to do with it other than closing the existing input stream, because the NumberFormatException already provides relevant information to the user.
Other possible solution would be using the console class and using a while loop instead of a for loop.

Challenge description:
Motivation:
This is a small algorithmic test. Beyond giving a correct solution, please also highlight possible algorithm
design tradeoffs and elaborate, why you choose your approach and maybe also what other solutions are
possible.
We prefer solutions in Java, since we run a Java backend. You donâ€™t need to use any build tools - just a
small executable main class would be fine as well.
Task:
You get a list (initialized to 0) of size X. You need to perform Y operations on it and print the maximum
value of all final values of all the Y elements in the list. For each operation, 3 integers are given - i,j and k
and you have to add value k to all the elements in the range of index i to j (both inclusive).
Input Format:
First line: two integers X and Y separated by one whitespace.
Next Y lines contain three numbers i, j and k separated by one whitespace.
Numbers in the list are numbered from 1 to X.
Constraints:
3 <= X <= 10
7
1 <= Y <= 2*10
5
1 <= i <=i <= X
0 <= k <= 10
9
Output Format:
A single line containing the maximum value in the list, after all operations are applied.
Sample Input:
5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100
Sample Output:
200
Explanation
After first update list will be 100 100 0 0 0. After second update list will be 100 200 100 100 100. After the
third update list will be 100 200 200 200 100.
So the required answer will be 200.
